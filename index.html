						<h1>Tutorial</h1>
							<p>Thank you for using my welcome to the game assistant, I will try to make this section as straight to the point so anyone reading can get on their way.</p>
							<details>
								<summary><h3>The Wiki Block</h3></summary>
								<p>The wiki block is the primary note taking tool and can be immensely helpful if you know how to use it. To begin, copy the website list from a deep wiki page in the game by using Ctrl+A and Ctrl+C, then paste the contents of the website into the input area at the top of the block. It will then scan and determine the websites on your wiki. Once your wiki sites are processed you will see their names, sub-pages, availability, and multiple markers.</p>
								<p>The markers can be used to indicate that you've searched a site and whether you have found anything on it so that you never forget where you need to search in the end-game for remaining keys. The buttons provided are for <i class="icon-search"></i> manual searches, <i class="icon-search-plus"></i> key cue aided searches, and whether a <i class="icon-key"></i> key or <i class="icon-link"></i> link has been found on the page.</p>
								<p>The final feature that may need explaining is the <i class="icon-mouse-pointer"></i> mouse button, clicking on it will show you a copy of the site you've clicked on with multiple indicators that show the games predetermined key click points. Yellow clickpoints will place a key somewhere on the page you are currently on while green clickpoints will place a key in a file on your desktop. In addition, cyan clickpoints are a combination of both and can trigger either event. Any location labelled as red is a potential place where a key can be placed on a page. This can be either just visibly or after finding a clickpoint that places the key on the page.</p>
							</details>
							<details>
								<summary><h3>The Notes Block</h3></summary>
								<p>The notes block is quite self-explanatory. The main purpose of this is that of a basic notepad that you can use to store keys, wiki links, and anything else you deem important. However, an additional feature is that any keys pasted into the textarea will be saved and compiled into the master key as you progressively find and enter the eight hidden keys.</p>
							</details>
							<details>
								<summary><h3>The Wifi Block</h3></summary>
								<p>The wifi block allows you to survey the many wifi networks present in the game. It will also provide information useful for cracking and accessing such wifis. Along with this, the block has password fields and an inbuilt tracking timer that will play a warning when you have one minute remaining to get off a network before the cops trace you.</p>
							</details>
							<details>
								<summary><h3>The Tenant Block</h3></summary>
								<p>The tenant block can be used to view a database of tenants located in Clint's apartment. It provides their ages, names, and their notes from the lobby computer. Along with this, it will also tell you if the tenant is a valid victim for the Doll Maker.</p>
							</details>
							<details>
								<summary><h3>The Info Block</h3></summary>
								<p>The information block is the background of this tool and provides various features. These include project credits and resources, guides for threats and important skills, customization settings, and an area in which you can find ways provide feedback on this project.</p>
							</details>
							<p><b>With that, you have everything you need to know to use this tool, get on out there and beat this game!</b></p>
					</div>
					<div title="The Game" icon="icon-circle">
						<h1>The Game</h1>
							<p>Welcome to the Game II is a horror game centered around the deep web where you are tasked with finding a female reporter kidnapped for looking into a group suspected of horrific activity. To save her you must search the game's websites to find 8 keys and gather 250 DosCoin to find her location. During this task you will face up against many killers, threats, and challenges while you race the clock. Perhaps you will be able to power through and join the 2% of players who have beat the game.</p>
					</div>
					<div title="The Computer" icon="icon-circle">
						<h1>The Computer</h1>
							<p>For the majority of the game, you will be stationed at your computer completing various tasks to aid in the collection of DosCoin, searching for keys, and exploring the deep web. To aid in this task, you have many programs and features on your computer desktop.</p>

							<details>
								<summary><h4>A.N.N.</h4></summary>
								<p>A.N.N (Anonymous Node Network) is your Deep Web browser which you will be utilizing to find keys and navigate the web. It is mostly self explainatory to operate... You have the arrows navigate forward or back a page, the home button to jump to deep wiki #1, the refresh button which refreshes the current site, and there is one more button on the right of the URL bar that opens the source code of the current website as well. In addition to deep wiki #1, two more can be found via searching pages. If you wish to know how to search the Deep Web, that is covered in the searching section.</p>
							</details>

							<details>
								<summary><h4>ZeroDay Market</h4></summary>
								<p>The ZeroDay Market can be used throughout the game to buy critical software and tools to aid in defending yourself or searching the Deep Web. These include applications that allow you to crack into other wifi networks, Backdoor Hacks that let you earn money from counter-hacking, and a Key Cue widget which helps you search for keys on the deep web.</p>
								<p><i>(Specific item information can be found under the markets guide)</i></p>
							</details>

							<details>
								<summary><h4>Shadow Market</h4></summary>
								<p>The Shadow Market can be used throughtout the game to buy important hardware items that will be useful throughout the game. Among the items sold are Motion Sensors which can be placed in the hallway, Remote VPNs that can be used to generate DosCoin, and better Wifi Dongles to help you search the Deep Web.</p>
								<p><i>(Specific item information can be found under the markets guide)</i></p>
							</details>

							<details>
								<summary><h4>Notes</h4></summary>
								<p>This section is quite self-explanatory. It is the in-game note taking program that can be used to store keys, passwords, or wiki addresses.</p>
							</details>

							<details>
								<summary><h4>Noir Tunnel</h4></summary>
								<p>The Noir Tunnel is your ultimate goal at the end of the game. To beat the game, you must enter the compiled master key into the tunnel and pay 250 DosCoin. At which point ███ ████ ████ ████ ███ ███ ████ ██ █████ ████ ███ █████ ██████.</p>
							</details>

							<details>
								<summary><h4>Skybreak</h4></summary>
								<p>Skybreak is a wifi cracking tool that can be purchased from the ZeroDay Market to hack into additional wifi networks. Additionally, libraries can be purchased to allow cracking of better networks. If you want to know how to crack networks, visit the cracking guide.</p>
							</details>

							<details>
								<summary><h4>The Status Bar</h4></summary>
								<p>The Status Bar at the top of the computer screen includes many menus and buttons that can be useful throughout the game. The following is what the icons do from left to right.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>The DosCoin icon shows you your current balance of DosCoin. Additionally, clicking on it will allow you to view information about currently placed remote VPNs and their performance. It lists each VPN's yield and seconds between yields.</li>
									<li>The Backdoor Hack label lists how many backdoor hacks you currently have installed.</li>
									<li>In the center you can see the in-game time displayed. It runs two times faster than real life time.</li>
									<li>The VPN Icon allows you to view and manage any purchased VPNs.</li>
									<li>The Motion Alert icon can be used to view and monitor any placed motion sensors. In addition, the task bar icon will blink if a motion sensor is triggered and Sound Alert is pruchased.</li>
									<li>The Wifi Icon will be quite familiar to those who regularly use PCs. It allows you to view nearby networks and log into them.</li>
									<li>The Sound Icon allows you to mute your PCs volume. An important note, doing this will mute all sounds produced by your PC.</li>
									<li>The Power Icon can be clicked to shutdown your PC.</li>
								</ul>
							</details>
					</div>
					<div title="The Building" icon="icon-circle">
						<h1>The Building</h1>
							<p>While quite a good amount of your time will be spent sitting at your computer, there are many important things you should know about your apartment and the building as a whole.</p>

							<p>When inside the computer interface you can right click to be able to look around and see your desk. Here you can reboot your computer by interacting with the box on the right of your desk if it is currently powered down. By right clicking again you will be able to get up and explore your room. While there is not much to see, there are some important things to note.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Your bedside table has a flashlight which will be useful later in the game. It is important to keep in mind that the flashlight has a limited battery life and cant be recharged in the event that it dies.</li>
								<li>Your apartment has various lights each with their own switch. While their purpose will not be discussed in this section, you should keep note of them.</li>
								<li>You can access the bathroom, the balcony, and the hallway by the doors located around the apartment.</li>
								<li>If you look on the left of your desk you will see your wifi dongle. It can be picked up and moved between 4 spots in your room, these spots include the window, the desk, the bedside table, and the table on your balcony. Moving your dongle to a new location will change the list of networks available on your PC.</li>
								<li>The closet next to the balcony and the shower located in the bathroom can be used as hiding places. Be mindful if you have not turned off your mic in your game settings as the game will listen to it and will deem you not truly hidden if you are caught making noise. These hiding places are relevant for a threat called the Hitman that is discussed in its own guide.</li>
							</ol>

							<p>Once you exit your apartment you will be in a hallway located on the 8th floor. Upon entering the stairwell, you will be able to freely travel up and down to other floors. The various other floors are relevant to a certain threat and the placement of Remote VPNs. The most important location you can access via the stairwell is the lobby which can be found on the bottom floor at the bottom of the stairwell. Once there, you can access the lobby computer or exit the front doors to visit the alley. The alley is where all Shadow Market purchases will be shipped by drone after purchase. Additionally, there is a small closet located on the right side of the alleyway used to counter a threat local to the alley if they are present during a visit.</p>
					</div>
					<div title="Searching" icon="icon-circle">
						<h1>Searching</h1>
							<p>An important skill for the game includes finding keys hidden within websites on the deep web. Keys can be found in a variety of ways and are always a number followed by a dash and a random string of 12 alphanumeric characters. 1 - a9b98dbc5745 It is quite easy to find these after you know where to look. Firstly, keys can be hidden in plain sight, this of course is the easiest and most straightforward method of which they can be hidden on a page. Secondly, keys and additionally the link to deep wiki #2 can be hidden in a page's source code. This method can be more unpredictable, but can be quite easy if you know what to look for. All keys or links hidden in this way will be hidden inside of an HTML comment which looks like the following. &lt;!-- 7 - f26aaaac89a4 --&gt; Finally, keys may be hidden in a site behind a clickpoint. This method is the hardest as it requires you to find and click on certain words or pictures in a site to reveal hidden keys. To do this, you may either bruteforce the locations or use a guide to find them. Once you find a functional clickpoint a sound will be played and the key will appear on the page itself or as a file on your desktop.</p>
							<p>In addition to finding keys, you will also need to find two hidden wiki pages to complete the game. Fortunately finding wikis is a much easier task to complete. The link to deep wiki #2 can be found on a website within the first wiki. It will always be hidden within the source code of the first page of the website it is hidden on. Unlike the link to deep wiki #2, the link to deep wiki #3 is always found on the website Rule of Three which is located on the deep wiki #2. To get the link, the site requires you to complete a trial and error memory puzzle. The puzzle consists of six sets of three dots each which must be solved in order. This puzzle is best completed earlier in a run since the solution will be randomized every time the page is reloaded.</p>
							<p>There are also a couple quirks with how keys and links are hidden that you can find below.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Keys and wiki links can exist on the same page, and can also both exist in the source code of a single page at the same time.</li>
								<li>Forgive me will never contain a key, but can contain a wiki link.</li>
								<li>Rule of Three can never contain a key.</li>
								<l1>Keys and key clickpoints will never appear inside of PGP key blocks, but they can be in the opening or closing text.</li>
							</ul>
					</div>
					<div title="Events" icon="icon-circle">
						<h1>Events</h1>
							<p>During your playthrough you will encounter two random events in addition to the killers attempting to hunt you.</p>
							<p>The first event is the blackout. This event is quite easy to beat as you must walk to the end of the hallway and turn the circuit breaker back on in the maintenance closet. This event requires that the player have the flashlight available to be able to navigate the pitch black hallway. It is important to keep in mind that the flashlight has a limited battery life and cant be recharged in the event that it dies. While the event isnt deadly by itself, Noir has a higher chance to spawn during the event since the darkness allows them to be more active. It is useful to be cautious due to this fact.</p>
							<p>The second event is hacks. These events are randomly occuring minigames which you must beat in order to avoid losing notes or DosCoin. In addition, hacks can be used as an easy method of DosCoin collection if you have Backdoor Hacks available. If you want more details about how hacks function, please refer to the hacking guide.</p>
					</div>
					<div title="The Markets" icon="icon-circle">
						<h1>The Markets</h1>
							<p>During your playthrough there are many useful items that can be purchased to help with evading threats, speeding up your internet, or generating DosCoin. The following is a list of the items available for purchase.</p>
							<h3>ZeroDay Market</h3>

					</div>
					<div title="The Police" icon="icon-circle">
						<h1>The Police</h1>
							<p>The police are the easiest threat in the game to avoid. To avoid them you must switch wifi networks before you exceed their respective tracking timers. Though if you forget to switch, the game only has a certain chance to trigger the swat team to break down your door based on the network you stayed on. <i>(If they are triggered, they will wait until you approach your front door or the stairwell door of floor eight before causing a game over.)</i> Despite death not being garunteed, you should avoid gambling on that chance. Another note to keep in mind is that networks that you disconnect from have a five minute timer before the police tracking timer on that network is reset. Connecting before this cooldown is complete will cause the police to resume their search from where they left off before you disconnected.</p>
							<p>the task of avoiding the cops can be made easier by purchasing skybreak from the ZeroDay Market and cracking higher security networks. Not only will they give you more time to breath, they often load websites faster.</p>
							<p><i>(In 1337 mode the tracking timers are shortened and the police shave a chunk of time off their timer every time you reconnect to a network that is in the middle of cooling down)</i></p>
							<p>The Police Scanner is an optional device that can be purchased to be alerted when the police are close to tracing you. When turned on, the police scanner will occasionally intercept and output random police communications. Certain phrases indicate that they are close to tracing you. Aside from this device, the police do not have any sound cues. <i>(Sound cues can be found below)</i></p>

						<h1>The Hitman</h1>
							<p>The Hitman (Also known as Lucas Kumiega) is an enemy that becomes active deeper into the game, they will become active after you have gone into three unique pages that have keys or after you accrue a total of three difficulty points by finding keys and forcing hacks. You can check whether or not they are active by checking if the window to the left of your desk is open. <i>(Please note that this is simplified for brevity, go to the bottom of this quide for a full explaination)</i></p>
							<p><i>(In 1337 mode the Hitman will be active immediately)</i></p>
							<p>The Hitman is a very difficult enemy to beat due to various reasons, but let's start from the bottom.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Remember to always lock your door. The Hitman is the only threat this mechanic is relevant to, but you should practice doing this regularly.</li>
								<li>Make sure that you can hear the lockpicking sound cue. Normally this is the only way to identify that the hitman is at your door and preparing to break in. <i>(Sound cue can be found below)</i></li>
								<li>Purchase and place motion sensors in addition to buying sound alert. This will give you a more effective method to know when the hitman is coming to your door in addition to giving you more time to hide. <i>(The motion sensors should be placed on the wall on both ends of the hallway, as the hitman can approach from both sides of the hallway)</i></li>
							</ol>
							<p>When you know the Hitman is currently preparing to barge in you must turn off your computer and hide in either the shower in the bathroom or the closet near your balcony. In either case you must be quiet as to not alert the hitman. <i>(This is only relevant if you have the mic enabled in your settings)</i> Also note that if you do not turn off the computer the hitman can erase notes saved into the game's internal notepad in addition to stealing portions of your DosCoin balance. During the time he is in your apartment, stay in your hiding place until you hear him leave. <i>(Sound cue can be found below)</i> You can affect the time he is in your apartment by turning off more lights in the seconds before you hide and prior.</p>
							<p>In addition to encountering the Hitman as he pays a visit to your apartment it is possible for them to kill you when returning to your apartment if they spawn when you are not currently inside the apartment. Unfortunately, if this rare event occurs it is impossible to avoid and you will die the next time you open a hallway door.</p>
							<details>
								<summary><b>Hitman Activation</b></summary>
								<p>The Hitman activates based off of a system of difficulty points in the game, this system has two factors that feed into it. For every key you find, you gain one difficulty point and you gain a difficulty point for every 3 forced hacks. <i>(Force hacking is a random event that can occur when visiting a dead site, more information can be found in the exploits section)</i> Whenever you get 3 difficulty points in total, the Hitman will activate and the window of your apartment will open. However, in 1337 mode you automatically start with 8 difficulty points which triggers the Hitman immediately.</p>
							</details>

								<summary><b>Hitman Simulater</b></summary>
								<p>If you want to work on improving your ability to hear the Hitmans lockpicking sound cue, I have created an alternate version of a tool created by a Welcome to the Game modder named Nasko. This tool can be found on the left side of the info block in the guide list.</p>

								<summary><b>Notes</b></summary>
								<ul>
									<li>The default sound cue for the hitman is very faint, you should set up your volume to account for this</li>
									<li>The hitman can erase the in-game notepad if the PC is not turned off during an encounter with him</li>
									<li>Your apartment lights affect how long the hitman stays during his visits, the more off the faster he leaves</li>
									<li>If the Hitman is at the door he can kill you if you use the peep hole</li>
									<li>It is a good investment to buy a pair of motion sensors and motion alert</li>

					<div title="The Noir" icon="icon-circle">
						<h1>The Noir</h1>
							<p>The Noir are a threat prevalent in the game. They appear randomly in various places such as in the apartment, the apartment window, the hallway, behind doors, and in rare cases behind the gate in the back of the alley.</p>
							<p>They are a basic threat to mitigate, but can quite easily catch those unfamiliar with them off gaurd. To make them go away, turn around as soon as you see them and count to ten. After this they should be gone. If not, repeat the process. However, they pose a more active threat when they spawn behind doorways. This often catches players who are attempting to rush to and from the alley/lobby and back as fast as possible. In addition, the Noir have a chance to instantly kill you if you have at least two lights turned off in your apartment. <i>(For more details of the Noir insta-kill, check below)</i>
							<details>
								<summary><b>Noir insta-kill</b></summary>
								<p>The noir insta-kill is one of the most dangerous aspects of the Noir. It allows the Noir to instantly kill the player if a few criteria are met.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>At least two lights in the apartment are off</li>
									<li>You have at least 4 difficulty points</li>
									<li>No other threat is currently active</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Noir will check if these criteria are met every 120 seconds, and if they are met you will be killed the next time you stand from your desk.</p>
								<details>
									<summary><h4>Difficulty Points</h4></summary>
									<p>The game has a system of difficulty points that affect how aggressive enemies are. For every key you find, you gain one difficulty point. Additionally, you gain a difficulty point for every 3 forced hacks you perform. <i>(Force hacking is a random event that can occur when visiting a dead site, more information can be found in the exploits section)</i> However, in 1337 mode you automatically start with 8 difficulty points which forces the Noir to start at maximum aggression.</p>

							<details>
								<summary><b>Notes</b></summary>
								<ul>
									<li>It is advised that you do not run through doors</li>
									<li>The Noir are more active in darkness, be careful if you turn your lights off or if the power goes out</li>
									<li>Make sure to occasionally check for the Noir in the window, on the balcony, and in the apartment</li>
